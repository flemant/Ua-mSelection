General principle of the method used to select m

Step 0) Creation of the two geometries and velocity field
They correspond to the surface velocity and geometry of a glacier at two different times. They are called v1, v2 for the velocities and (s1,h1), (s2,h2) 
for the geometries.

Now I suppose I do not know the sliding parameters of Weertman law C and m, but I know the flow parameters A and n. I want to estimate m. 
The method consists in three steps detailed below.\
I am going to repeat theses steps with several values of m=mi

Step 1) Invert the first velocity field and geometry setting m=mi, for log(A) and log(C)\
This gives me an estimate of C associated to mi. I call this estimated slipperiness Ci.\
No matter the value of mi, the inversion should converge towards a correct value for Ci. The fact that the inversion converges thus tells nothing about the 
rightness of mi; this is why a second geometry is needed.

Step 2) Launch a diagnostic run with the second geometry and the parameters Ci, mi (and A, n)\
This gives me a calculated velocity v2calc(Ci,mi)\
If mi is the right m, then Ci is close to the right C and v2calc is almost equal to v2. Otherwise, there is no reason why v2calc and v2 should be equal, because
v1 and v2 are different.

Step 3) Minimise the misfit between v2 and v2calc\
A cost function Gamma can be defined as the misfit between v2calc and v2 integrated over the mesh. Gamma is a function of mi. The mi minimising Gamma is the 
best estimate of m.

This method is implemented in the script mSelection/mSelect oand the function mSelection/mSelectFunction which can be called with the script
mSelection/mSelectUsingFunction.
